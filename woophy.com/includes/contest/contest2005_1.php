<h1>Picture the World - Results</h1>
<h4>1 September - 1 December 2005</h4>
<p><strong>Dear Woophy friends and participants, finally the long awaited end results of our 2005 'Picture the World' photo contest.</strong></p>
<h2>And the winner is...</h2>
<p>From the long list of 600 photos each jury member could select about 40 photos for the shortlist. This resulted in a shortlist of about 200 photos with many of the photo's selected by two or more jury members.</p>
<p>On the final judgement day December the 2nd all the photo's from the shortlist were discussed by the jury. In a determination process the selection was narrowed down to 52 photos having three votes or more or being personal favourites of one of the jury members. 
</p>
<p>In a lively and organic discussion the last 52 photos where sorted in to categories and winners where chosen. Since the photo's where judged anonymously some photographers where present with more then one photo.

<h2>Winner Overall Category</h2>

<a href="<?php echo ROOT_PATH?>photo/13815"><img class="contest" src="<?php echo ROOT_PATH?>images/contest/2005_13815.jpg" /></a><a href="<?php echo ROOT_PATH?>member/amorph" target="_blank">Mads Iversen</a><br/>Paris, France
<p>The winner overall category <a href="<?php echo ROOT_PATH?>member/amorph" target="_blank">Mads Iversen</a> (amorph) was chosen unanimously. According to Vincent Mentzel this is a real 'world' photo. We see a group of people standing on the earth warmed by the sun. The essence of life on earth. <br/><br/>Also the photo is sufficiently abstract to be a truly overall winner. The people on the photo are not black or white, muslim or jew, poor or rich, they are just people living under the sun seeming small from above and sharing the same earth.<br/><br/>The long shadows and its original point of view made that the photo was noticed by all the jury members immediately as a potential winner.</p>

		<td><b>1st prize, </b><a href="<?php echo ROOT_PATH?>member/zerega">Stefan Sonntag</a><br/>Phumi Spean Angkor, Cambodia
		<br/><br/>
		In the category nature Stefan Sonntag (zerega) won with his photo of Phumi Spean Angkor; Cambodia. Other than most nature photos on the shortlist this photo is strongly related to culture. It is this tension between the tree and the temple which gives this photo also a symbolic meaning.
		</td>
		<td><b>2nd prize, </b><a href="<?php echo ROOT_PATH?>member/Izan%20Petterle">Izan Petterle</a><br/>Delfim Moreira, Brazil
		<br/><br/>Again a photo like a painting won a prize, this time by Izan Petterle from Brazil. It is a landscape with a dog from Delfim Moreira Brazil. Like the winner in the category nature this is also more then just a beautiful scenery. The (domesticated) dog provides a nice story connecting the nature with culture again. The surrealistic light and scenery add to the atmosphere of an old English hunting scene painting.

	<tr>
		<td><b>1st prize, </b><a href="<?php echo ROOT_PATH?>member/Fotoworks">Peter Voerman</a><br/>Volterra, Italy
		<br/><br/>The winner in this category is Peter Voerman (Fotoworks) from The Netherlands for his photo of a girl in a church in Volterra Italy. The jury was struck by the beauty and innocence of this girl in the church. Also some of the jury members saw parallels between this photo and seventeenth century paintings.
		</td>
		<td><b>2nd prize, </b><a href="<?php echo ROOT_PATH?>member/zerega">Stefan Sonntag</a><br/>Aleppo, Syrian Arab
		<br/><br/>In the category culture Stefan won (only) a second prize. The prize for the photo citadel of Aleppo, Syrian Arab must also be seen as appreciation for the whole series of his Middle East photos.

	<tr>
		<td><b>1st prize, </b><a href="<?php echo ROOT_PATH?>member/zerega">Stefan Sonntag</a><br/>Acomayo, Peru
		<br/><br/>In the category people the jury choose the truck driver helpers (bomberos) in Acomayo, Peru. It is a beautiful photo in itself, dynamic full of movement, but also a very exotic subject. This must be one of the most dangerous professions in the world.
		</td>
		<td><b>2nd prize, </b><a href="<?php echo ROOT_PATH?>member/eslwinshot">Edwin S. Loyola</a><br/>Batangas, Phillipines
		<br/><br/>Edwin S. Loyola (eslwinshot) from The Philippines took care of the rough edge among the prize winners. Although the photo is very small and a little grainy it is so strong that it convinced the jury to take a second look and replace the original second prize. The photo combines in a very special way the gloominess of life on earth with the optimism of playing children.

<h2>At Last</h2>
<p>We hope you enjoyed the contest as much as we did, it was really great organizing it though a little much work for a small organisation like ours. After all we feel that the best photos won but we also want to express our great appreciation to all the photographers who didn't win. I think even our long list of 600 photos wasn't long enough to contain all the potential winners. Thanks and we hope you join our 2006 competition <strong>'A cross section of daily life on earth in 12 months'</strong>.
