<h1>Daily Life on Earth - Results</h1>
<h4>December 2006 - Family</h4>
<p><strong>It is not a photo of a family around a Christmas three with a blizzard going on outside which won Decembers competition. No it is an extremely sunny and colorful photo by takefive which won this month. A brother and a sister (at least we hope the two are related because the theme was family and not friendship) sitting on a sidewalk eating ice cream. The yellow of the wall, the green sunglasses, the bright clothes and the cute kids made that the photo was chosen unanimously by the Woophy jurors as winner. Congratulations takefive we sure hope to see more of your photos, you won a copy of ‘Photographer's Life: 1990-2005’ by Annie Leibovitz.</strong></p>
<p>The honorable mentions go to Sara G. and Kennel. Sara G. wins the mention for her photo of three generations. A universal situation pictured very originally. Kennel wins his honorable mention for the Thai family resting on the tracks. The black and white photo is technically and composition wise already very good. The somewhat worried or tired expression of the father give the photo extra drama. Very well done all!!</p>
